TYPES OF TASKS UNDER REGULATION OF THE FOUNDATION PROJECT
=========================================================

I. Summary

In order to carry out tasks of different kinds but a same kind of tasks, which often involve repeative works or process and procedures, categorising them and making a unique system regulating those works to be carried out in a uniform way is found practical to Li Ao and such approach often result in reduced intensive of working. This comes to the eternal principle of repeative tasks, that if doing those repeative works which can be simplified in a non-simplified way it requires more unnecessary manpower, if to be done by humans, or resources of other kinds, if to be done in other ways.

In order to simplify the works to eliminate unnecessary repeative works, many common tasks that are highly possible to be done by Li Ao frequently will be categorised into different types of works. Such classification gives vital indexation of what type of works by nature they are, and how to carry out these works to eliminate repeative works. Simplified working procedure does not automatically constitute degraded working quality, the output is decided by many factors including whether or not the designated working proceures to carry out with these simplified ways be followed strictly for the sake of correct operations; for example, by evaluating whether the worker still clearly and surely remembers which fields in a table stand for in order to constructing tables to document information that will have to compose a significant amount of repeative paragraphs in order to document them in conventional forms, it gives a decisive outcome that whether or not such worker can carry out these works efficiently, and accurately which guarantees the quality.

In fact, by leveraging the methodology of this approach, it had already been proven to be eliminating a significant amount of repeative works for Li Ao while can also simultaneously ensuring an excellent overall working quality on making accuracy and precise works. Li Ao can reconfirm and reaffirm himself after doing that key information that must be ensured to carry out these kind of works, and as a result, he eliminated repeative works and increased efficiency while had also guaranteed a contemporary excellent job on avoiding mistakes that can be caused because of the adverse effects of using such a working methods.

Most importantly, by making many different kinds of works having similar or same charactieristics standardlised to be having a regular form of methods for carrying the works, in the future such works are easy to be made possible to be finished by computers or other logical apparatus. This comes to Li Ao's long-term outlook to computerising many of his works for his own purposes or his business, in the hope of building a modern, state-of-the-art system of business governance that comes with high intricacies designed by deep human civilisation. Such approach is to realising his dream of becoming a civilised individual and of proving that he as a human individual with Han Chinese ethnicity is capable of being educated with Western knowledges that Western people can be educated with, and of which is also included in the dream, to proving to the international world that Han Chinese people can also become civilised as Western people can be done so.
