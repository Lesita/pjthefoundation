METHODOLOGY AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTING DOCUMENTATION FOR PURPOSES OF EVENT DOCUMENTING
=======================================================================================

I. Methodology Overview

Constructing documentation for purposes of event documenting involves several important steps. This includes the determination of infomation to be documented to figure out which kind of information to be documented; the consideration of form of purposed documentation to be constructed in, in order to ensure good record of information and to achieve a higher performance of using such documentation in a future time. Doing these steps are not a simple hit, however by figuring out the objective and knowing well all the available methods available, it's not a difficult and exhausting thing to choosing the right, desired way for doing so.

The vital factors of determination of modes to construct a documentation which documents events that had happened in the past, involves the following non-exhaustive items:

	a. The best way ever possible that can be done, to document everything of the events precisely while also ensuring readability by humans in case of need;

	b. The best way ever possible that can be done, to ensure efficient archivel of documentation for the purpose of further retrieval;

	c. The best way ever possible that can be done, to make computeralised processing of such documented details possible, and if it can be made possible, efficient on the processing and annexation by such computer systems.

As different kind of events happen and many kinds of those events can furtherly be categorised by different subjects, subsidiary methodologies and methods on documenting such specific categorised events of different subjects should be furtherly developed, apart from and based on a general, provisional methodogoly and methods of events documentation; these subsidiary methods and methodologies must adhere to those general principles while sometimes can include their own characteristics that come in addition to those provisional measures. For example, provisional measures prescribe a documentation of events shall include the place of commencement, however in order to preserve privacy and to omit unnecessary details, documenting events of random items being captured on the street could omit the location of where these items were being captured, while only focusing on the items themselves and including an appropriate or broader location of commencement of the events, for example, District 2, WP Putrajaya, Malaysia instead of Putrajaya Square, District 2, WP Putrajaya, Malaysia.

Similarly, sometimes a subsidiary method of recording particular types of infomration does not conceptually distinguish itself from recording generic types of events. In this case, they still fall under the general type of documentation regarding the documentation of events, however those individual methods of documentation make the constructed documentation using their methods having different structure information, as defined in the document Types of Information. Honouring structure of event documentation is also very important to sorting out the purpose of documentation that had been constructed.
