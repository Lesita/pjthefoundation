I. INTRODUCTION

The Foundation Project situates as a core, foundation system
that provides basis of a management framework on the way to
carry out some select works of Li Ao. This framework aims at
resolving the long-lasting problem of lack of management of
many random works carried out by Li Ao, by building up an
apparatus that works to organising the workflow of the jobs,
as well as to building up a well-furnished record documenta-
tion system, to enable the ability of using precise technol-
ogies to throtting the working pace, regulating the methodo-
logies, and to documenting records in an efficient way, with
the possibilities of furtherly extending the depth of techn-
ology to become more precise and accurate.

In the past, when random works are taking place Li Ao usual-
ly focus on doing the interested things, while keeping some-
thing necessary for future works intact; that means those
being held for future clearance might never get a chance to
finish, as over times badly or non-documented information
becomes more harder to be retrieved as context and informat-
ion fades out naturally. Also, those badly-managed jobs mig-
ht be completely voided because of their ill-fated manageme-
nt, for example important files became vanished as the
residing storage medium became broken. Carrying out these
important works randomly without a proven methodology
would only makes contrary progress as losing critical
elements, which are missing from the outcome of these
randomly executed works, makes the results become no value
while also disproportionately wastes the time spent on them.

After nearly two decades of exploration, Li Ao had now furn-
ished an appropriate management framework that can be proven
theortically correct, meaning that with further formalise
works these jobs can be executed well-organised, well-docum-
ented while making expected outcome, which furtherly
creating values to his desire. As he now has ample time
doing these formalise works, the first project amongst other
projects to be planned, called The Foundation Project, is
presented here in the form of electronic documents to
prescribe the vital, critical rules and policies of carrying
out specific works under the framework the project also
furnishes.

Simply put in one sentence, the purpose of this project
is to "Setting up intricacies to enable a foundation which
helps necessary tasks managed well in a regulated and regul-
arised manner."

II. ARTICLES OF THIS PROJECT

This project contains the following articles:

-- A comprehensive framework summoning a general, principal
   task management system to be enforced by Li Ao with
   self-assessment schedules;

-- A framework summoning enforcement measures on quality
   of tasks carried out on the aforementioned framework,
   and an ethics regulatory regime to be enforced when
   carrying out tasks under such framework (for which these
   two articles both give general provisions as an outer
   framework);

-- General baseline of quality of tasks carried out under
   the aforementioned framework.

III. REFLECTIONS OF THIS PROJECT

This project is reflected in the forms of electronic
documents, which are managed by file systems to
distinguish each of them with others, with the text
document or other formats or both, provided they are
in formats de facto accepted as industrial norms.

In the future, this project may be furtherly reconstructur-
ed with document formats that meets Li Ao's own requiremen-
ts while also satisying industry standards or adhering to
industry norms.
